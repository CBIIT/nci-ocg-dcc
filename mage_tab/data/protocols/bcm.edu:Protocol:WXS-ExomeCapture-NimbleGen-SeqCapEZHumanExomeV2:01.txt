Exome capture: Illumina pre-capture libraries (1 ug DNA input) were hybridized in solution to SeqCap EZ Human 
Exome 2.0 (Nimblegen, Madison, WI) probes targeting approximately 44Mbs of sequence from approximately 30K genes 
according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications: hybridization enhancing oligos IHE1, 
IHE2 and IHE3 replaced oligos HE1.1 and HE2.1 and post-capture LM-PCR was performed using 14 cycles. Capture 
libraries were quantified using Caliper GX 1K/12K/High Sensitivity Assay Labchip (Hopkinton, MA, Cat. No. 760517). 
The efficiency of the capture was evaluated by performing a qPCR-based quality check on the built-in controls 
(qPCR SYBR Green assays, Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY). Four standardized oligo sets, RUNX2, PRKG1, SMG1, 
and NLK, were employed as internal quality controls. The enrichment of the capture libraries was estimated to 
range from 7- to 9-fold over background.
