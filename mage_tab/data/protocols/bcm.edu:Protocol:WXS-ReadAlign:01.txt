Mapping Reads: Illumina HiSeq bcl files were processed using BCLConvertor v1.7.1. All reads from the 
prepared libraries that passed the Illumina Chastity filter were formatted into fastq files. The fastq 
files were aligned to human reference genome build37 (NCBI) using BWA (bwa-0.5.9-R16) with default 
parameters with the following exceptions: seed sequence: 40 bpseed mismatch: 2, total mismatches 
allowed: 3. BAM files generated from alignment were preprocessed using GATK (v1.3-8-gb0e6afe) 
[1] to recalibrate and locally realign reads.
