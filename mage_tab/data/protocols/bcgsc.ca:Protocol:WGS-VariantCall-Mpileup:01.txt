SNVs were analyzed with SAMtools mpileup v.0.1.17 (Li et al., 2009) either on single or paired libraries. 
Each chromosome was analyzed separately using the -C50-DSBuf parameters. The resulting vcf files were 
merged and filtered to remove low quality SNVs by using samtools varFilter (with default parameters) 
as well as to remove SNVs with a QUAL score of less than 20 (vcf column 6). Finally, SNVs were annotated 
with gene annotations from ensembl v66 using snpEff (Cingolani et al., 2012b) and the dbSNP v137 db 
membership assigned using snpSift  (Cingolani et al., 2012a).
