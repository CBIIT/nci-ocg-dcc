Structural variant detection was performed using Trans-ABySS (v1.4.6). 
For RNA-seq assembly alternate k-mers from k50-k96 were performed 
using positive strand and ambiguous stand reads as well as 
negative strand and ambiguous strand reads. The positive and negative 
strand assemblies were extended where possible, merged and then 
concatenated together to produce a meta-assembly contig dataset. The 
meta-assemblies were then used as input to the Trans-ABySS analysis 
pipeline (Robertson et al., 2010). Large scale rearrangements and gene 
fusions from RNA-seq libraries were identified from contigs that had high 
confidence GMAP (v2012-12-20) alignments to two distinct genomic regions. 
Evidence for the alignments were provided from aligning reads back to the 
contigs and from aligning reads to genomic coordinates. Events were then 
filtered on read thresholds. Large scale rearrangements and gene fusions 
from WGS libraries were identified in a similar way, but using BWA 
(v0.6.2-r126) alignments. Insertions and deletions were identified by 
gapped alignment of contigs to the human reference using GMAP for RNA-seq 
and BWA for WGS. Confidence in the event was calculated from the alignment 
of reads back to the event breakpoint in the contigs.  The events were then 
screened against dbSNP and other variation databases to identify putative 
novel events. To determine compartment specific events the structural 
variant calls for each patient from all matched genome and RNA-seq samples 
were concatenated together and screened against matching genome tumour, and 
where available germline bam files. This resulted in compartment specific 
structural variant events and where germline was available putative somatic 
and germline events. The events were further filtered against a compendium 
of germline structural variants to remove recurrent false positives.
