Verification of putative SNV and Indel mutation calls from whole exome sequencing was performed using 
alternative instrumentation and chemistries to avoid any systematic errors inherent to the processes 
described above. We submitted sample-sites for amplification by PCR followed by analysis on the 
Ion Torrent sequencing platform.  Ion Torrent libraries were constructed using Life Technologies 
protocols and reagents (Cat. No. 4471269).  Briefly, 500 ug of amplicon DNA (143 bp average size) was 
processed through end-repair, followed by ligation with Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters (1-32; Cat. No. 
4471250 and 4474009) and purification with Agencourt XP beads.  The resultant libraries were quantified 
using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA Chip 7500 (Cat. No. 5067-1506) and then pooled for sequencing.  
Library templates were clonally amplified on Ion Sphere Particles (ISPs) through emulsion PCR and then 
enriched for template-positive ISPs using manufacturer reagents (Cat. No. 4479878). Approximately 35 
million template-positive ISPs were deposited onto each Ion 318C chip (Cat. No. 4484355).
