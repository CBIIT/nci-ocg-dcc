For exome capture, four pre-capture libraries were pooled together in equimolar amounts (totaling 1 ug/pool). 
These pooled libraries were then hybridized in solution to the HGSC VCRome 2.1 design1 (42Mb, NimbleGen) 
according to the manufacturer's protocol NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome Library SR User's Guide (Version 2.2) 
with minor revisions.  Human COT1 DNA and full-length Illumina adaptor-specific blocking oligonucleotides 
were added into the hybridization to block repetitive genomic sequences and the adaptor sequences. 
Post-capture LM-PCR amplification was performed using KAPA HiFi DNA Polymerase with 12 cycles of amplification. 
After the final AMPure XP bead purification, quantity and size of the capture library was analyzed using the 
Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA Chip 7500.  The efficiency of the capture was evaluated by performing a qPCR-based 
quality check on the four standard NimbleGen internal controls.  Successful enrichment of the capture libraries 
was estimated to range from a 6 to 9 of 'Ct value over the non-enriched samples.
