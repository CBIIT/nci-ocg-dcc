An in-house tool, Genome Validator was used to determine compartment 
specific events. The structural variant calls for each patient from 
matched genome and RNA-seq samples were concatenated together and 
screened for each patient against matching tumour and germline 
alignments. This resulted in compartment specific structural variant 
events and putative somatic calls. The events were further filtered 
against a compendium of recurrent structural variants to remove 
recurrent false positives.
