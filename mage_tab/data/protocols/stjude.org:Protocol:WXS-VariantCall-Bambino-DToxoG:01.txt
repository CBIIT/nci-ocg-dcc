Of the 1,131 paired tumor-normal WES data, all except for 23 osterosarcoma 
pairs exhibit the expected binomial distribution of variant allele fraction 
for known germline SNPs. The 23 outlier samples were not used for discovery 
of driver genes due to their abnormal profile of variant allele distribution. 
They were included only for determining mutation prevalence of the driver 
genes identified in this study. Somatic SNVs and indels were detected by 
the Bambino program followed by postprocessing and manual curation as 
previously described. As 8-oxo-G artifact has been reported previously, we 
implemented an 8-oxo-G filter following the principles described in the 
D-ToxoG (http://archive.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/dtoxog) algorithm. 
The filter was tested on the "Exome_Native" neuroblastoma samples known to 
have 8-oxo-G artifacts and then applied to the variants identified in all 
WES data set.
