Library templates were prepared for sequencing using Illumina's cBot cluster generation system with 
TruSeq PE Cluster Generation Kits (Part no. PE-401-3001).  Briefly, these libraries were denatured with 
sodium hydroxide and diluted to 6-9 pM in hybridization buffer in order to achieve a load density of 
~800K clusters/mm2.  Each library pool was loaded in a single lane of a HiSeq flow cell, and each lane 
was spiked with 2% phiX control library for run quality control.  The sample libraries then underwent 
bridge amplification to form clonal clusters, followed by hybridization with the sequencing primer.  
Sequencing runs were performed in paired-end mode using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.  Using the 
TruSeq SBS Kits (Part no. FC-401-3001), sequencing-by-synthesis reactions were extended for 101 cycles 
from each end, with an additional 7 cycles for the index read.  Sequencing runs generated approximately 
300-400 million successful reads on each lane of a flow cell, with approximately 9-10 Gb produced per sample.  
With these sequencing yields, samples achieved an average of 95% of the targeted exome bases covered to a 
depth of 20X or greater.
