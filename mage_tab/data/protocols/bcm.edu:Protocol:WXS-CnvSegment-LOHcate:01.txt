CNA analysis was performed using LOHcate, a method that identifies CNA 
events in whole exome tumor sequence data via detecting enrichment in 
variant or reference allele quantities per site across polymorphic 
exonic sites. The per-site quantities are plotted two-dimensionally 
between matched normal and tumor. Significant sites are then clustered 
in this Euclidean 2D space using an optimized version of the 
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) 
algorithm, after which clusters are classified to denote the appropriate 
CNA events: somatic gain, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or copy neutral 
LOH (cnLOH). The sites within these classified CNA clusters are mapped 
back to the exome, which is subsequently segmented into CNA regions. 
Regions and sub-regions of low to high recurrence are identified by 
comparing CNA regions across samples. Segments with 200 or more markers 
were visualized by Partek software (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO) and 
utilized in the analysis.
