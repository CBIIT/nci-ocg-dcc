To remove cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) species from total RNA NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit for Human/Mouse/Rat was used (NEB, E6310X). Enzymatic reactions were set-up in a 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Microlab NIMBUS liquid handler (Hamilton Robotics, USA). 100ng of DNase I treated total RNA in 6 µL was hybridized to rRNA probes in a 7.5 µL reaction. Heat-sealed plates were incubated at 95oC for 2 minutes followed by incremental reduction in temperature by 0.1oC per second to 22oC (730 cycles). The rRNA in DNA hybrids were digested using RNase H in a 10 µL reaction incubated in a thermocycler at 37oC for 30 minutes. To remove excess rRNA probes (DNA) and residual genomic DNA contamination, DNase I was added in a total reaction volume of 25 µL and incubated at 37oC for 30 minutes. RNA was purified using RNA MagClean DX beads (Aline Biosciences, USA) with 15 minutes of binding time, 7 minutes clearing on a magnet followed by two 70% ethanol washes, 5 minutes to air dry the RNA pellet and elution in 36uL DEPC water.   The plate containing RNA was stored at -80oC prior to cDNA synthesis. 
First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the purified RNA (minus rRNA) using the Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo-Fisher, USA) and random hexamer primers at a concentration of 8ng/µL along with a final concentration of 0.4µg/µL Actinomycin D, followed by PCR Clean DX bead purification on a Microlab NIMBUS robot (Hamilton Robotics, USA). The second strand cDNA was synthesized following the NEBNext Ultra Directional Second Strand cDNA Synthesis protocol (NEB) that incorporates dUTP in the dNTP mix, allowing the second strand to be digested using USERTM enzyme (NEB) in the post-adapter ligation reaction and thus achieving strand specificity.
cDNA was fragmented by Covaris LE220 sonication for 130seconds (2x65seconds) at a “Duty cycle” of 30%, 450 Peak Incident Power (W) and 200 Cycles per Burst in a 96-well microTUBE Plate (P/N:  520078) to achieve 200-250 bp average fragment lengths. The paired-end sequencing library was prepared following the BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre strand-specific, plate-based library construction protocol on a Microlab NIMBUS robot (Hamilton Robotics, USA). Briefly, the sheared cDNA was subject to end-repair and phosphorylation in a single reaction using an enzyme premix (NEB) containing T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow DNA Polymerase and T4 polynucleotide kinase, incubated at 20oC for 30 minutes. Repaired cDNA was purified in 96-well format using PCR Clean DX beads (Aline Biosciences, USA), and 3’ A-tailed (adenylation) using Klenow fragment (3’ to 5’ exo minus) and incubation at 37oC for 30 minutes prior to enzyme heat inactivation. Illumina PE adapters were ligated at 20oC for 15 minutes. The adapter-ligated products were purified using PCR Clean DX beads, then digested with USERTM enzyme (1 U/µL, NEB) at 37oC for 15 minutes followed immediately by 13 cycles of indexed PCR using Phusion DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. USA) and Illumina’s PE primer set. PCR parameters: 98˚C for 1 minute followed by 13 cycles of 98˚C  15 seconds, 65˚C  30 seconds and 72˚C  30 seconds, and then 72˚C  5 minutes. The PCR products were purified and size-selected using a 1:1 PCR Clean DX beads-to-sample ratio (twice), and the eluted DNA quality was assessed with Caliper LabChip GX for DNA samples using the High Sensitivity Assay (PerkinElmer, Inc. USA) and quantified using a Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit on a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) prior to library pooling and size-corrected final molar concentration calculation for Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing with paired-end 75 base reads.
