Mutation Detection:  Sequence variants were called from tumor and matched normal BAM files using Atlas [2] an integrative 
variant analysis suite of tools specializing in the separation of true SNPs and insertions and deletions (indels) from 
sequencing and mapping errors in whole exome capture sequencing (WXS) data.  The suite implements logistic regression 
models trained on validated WXS data to identify the true variants. ATLAS-SNP-2 (v1.3) [3] and ATLAS-Indel-2 (v0.3.1) 
along with Pindel (v0.2.4q) [4] were run on the BAM files producing variant data that were further filtered to remove 
all those observed fewer than 5 times or were present in less than 0.08 of the reads (e.g., variant allele fraction must 
be greater than 0.08 to undergo validation). At least one variant read of Q30 or better was required, and the variant had 
to lie in the central portion of the read (15% from the 5' end of the read and 20% from the 3' end).  In addition, reads 
harboring the variant must have been observed in both forward and reverse orientations.  Finally, the variant base was not 
observed in the normal tissue. Indels were discovered by similar processing except indels must have been observed in at 
least 10 of the reads.
