Illumina paired-end whole genome sequencing reads were aligned to the hg19 
reference using BWA version 0.5.7.  This reference contains chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, 
MT, 20 unlocalized scaffolds and 39 unplaced scaffolds. Multiple lanes of sequences 
were merged and duplicated reads were marked with Picard Tools.
