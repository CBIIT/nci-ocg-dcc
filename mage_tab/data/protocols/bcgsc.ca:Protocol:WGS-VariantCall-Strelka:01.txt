To analyze compartment specific SNVs, samples were analyzed pair wise with the default settings of Strelka v0.4.7 (Saunders et al., 2012).  
Primary tumor samples and relapse/met were compared against the germline sample. In the absence of a germline sample, 
the relapse/met samples were compared against the primary tumor sample.
