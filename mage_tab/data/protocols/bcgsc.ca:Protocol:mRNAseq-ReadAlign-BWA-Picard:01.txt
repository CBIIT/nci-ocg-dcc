Illumina paired-end RNA sequencing reads were aligned to GRCh37-lite genome-plus-junctions reference using BWA version 0.5.7. 
This reference combined genomic sequences in the GRCh37-lite assembly and exon-exon junction sequences whose corresponding 
coordinates were defined based on annotations of any transcripts in Ensembl (v59), Refseq and known genes from the UCSC 
genome browser, which was downloaded on August 19 2010, August 8 2010, and August 19 2010, respectively. Reads that mapped 
to junction regions were then repositioned back to the genome, and were marked with 'ZJ:Z' tags. BWA is run using default 
parameters, except that the option (-s) is included to disable Smith-Waterman alignment. Finally, reads failing the 
Illumina chastity filter are flagged with a custom script, and duplicated reads were flagged with Picard Tools.
