Illumina sequencing libraries were amplified by a bridge-amplification process using Illumina HiSeq 
pair read cluster generation kits (TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v2.5) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. 
Briefly, the libraries were denatured with sodium hydroxide and diluted to 3-4 pM in hybridization buffer for loading 
onto a single lane of a flow cell in order to achieve 600-700k clusters/mm. All lanes were spiked with 1% phiX 
control library. Cluster formation, primer hybridization were performed on the flow cell with Illumina's cBot 
cluster generation system. Sequencing was performed in paired-end mode on Illumina Hiseq 2000 instruments. 
Sequencing reactions were extended for 202 cycles of SBS using TruSeq SBS Kit. 
The Illumina Sequence Control Software (SCS) controlled reagent delivery and collected raw images.
