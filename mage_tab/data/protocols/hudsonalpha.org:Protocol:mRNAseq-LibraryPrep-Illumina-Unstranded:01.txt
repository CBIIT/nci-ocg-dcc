1 ug of high-quality total RNA was used for conversion of mRNA into a cDNA library of template molecules based on mRNA capture with poly(T) magnetic beads, fragmentation, and reverse transcription to first-strand cDNA with reverse transcriptase and random primers, using Illumina?s TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After adaptor ligation, each cDNA library was purified and enriched by PCR amplification; the final average fragment size, including adaptors, was 280 bases.
