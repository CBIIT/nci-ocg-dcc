MAF files containing structural variants identified by CGI were downloaded 
from the TARGET Data Matrix and filtered to remove germline rearrangements 
and low confidence somatic calls. Germline variant databases used for 
filtering included the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), dbSNP, PCGP, 
and also recurrent germline rearrangements from the downloaded MAF files. 
Rearrangements where both breakpoints fall into gap regions in the human 
genome (hg19) were also excluded. To filter out low confidence 
rearrangements, a BLAT search was performed on the assembled sequence for 
each rearrangement, and those that could be fully mapped (>90% similarity 
to the reference genome) were excluded. We further required each variant 
to have an assembled contig length of at least 10 bp on each breakpoint. 
Since copy number alterations were highly coupled with rearrangement events, 
to avoid over-filtering we also integrated the copy number alterations into 
the SV analysis. Briefly, breakpoints from CNV analysis were matched to 
those detected in SVs, using a window size of 5kb. Those rearrangements 
with possible CNV support were rescued after manual curation. 
Of the 1,011,810 putative CGI SVs, 3,265 passed these filters. Experimental 
verification using 14 CGI diagnosis-remission-relapse trio samples from a 
previous publication6 showed a validation rate of 78% as 79 out of the 101 
SVs were experimentally verified by targeted capture sequencing.
