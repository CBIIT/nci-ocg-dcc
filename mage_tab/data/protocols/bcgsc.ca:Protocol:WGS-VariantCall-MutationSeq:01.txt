SNVs were analyzed pair wise with SAMtools mpileup v.0.1.17 (Li et al., 2009).  Each chromosome was analyzed separately using 
the -C50-DSBuf parameters. Before merging the resulting vcf files, they were filtered to remove all indels and low quality 
SNVs by using samtools varFilter (with default parameters) as well as to remove SNVs with a QUAL score of less than 20 
(vcf column 6).  The SNVs in the resulting vcf files were further filtered and scored using mutationSeq v1.0.2 and annotated 
with gene annotations from ensembl v66 using snpEff (Cingolani et al., 2012b)  and the dbSNP v137 and cosmic 64 db membership 
using snpSift  (Cingolani et al., 2012a).
