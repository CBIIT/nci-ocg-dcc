Small RNAs, containing microRNA (miRNA), in the flow-through material following mRNA purification 
on a MultiMACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) are recovered by ethanol precipitation. 
MiRNA-seq libraries are constructed using a 96-well plate-based protocol developed at the BC 
Cancer Agency, Genome Sciences Centre.  Briefly, an adenylated single-stranded DNA 3' adapter is 
selectively ligated to miRNAs using a truncated T4 RNA ligase2 (NEB Canada, cat. M0242L). An RNA 5'
adapter is then added, using a T4 RNA ligase (Ambion USA, cat. AM2141) and ATP. Next, first strand
cDNA is synthesized using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, cat.18064 014), and 
serves as the template for PCR. Index sequences (6 nucleotides) are introduced at this PCR step to 
enable multiplexed pooling of miRNA libraries. PCR products are pooled, then size-selected on an 
in-house developed 96-channel robot to enrich the miRNA containing fraction and remove adapter 
contaminants. Each size-selected indexed pool is ethanol precipitated and quality checked on an 
Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip and quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, cat. Q32854).
