ChIP-Seq (From Johann et al. (2016) Cancer Cell)
Chromatin Immunoprecipitations for H3K27Ac, BRD4, OTX2, and MITF was performed at ActiveMotif (Carlsbad, CA) using the following antibodies: 39133, lot7 ActiveMotif (H3K27Ac), A301-985A100-3, Bethyl laboratories (BRD4), 13497-1-AP, lot 1, ProteinTech (OTX2), 39789 lot1, ActiveMotif (MITF). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq 2000 systems (single-end, read length: 50 bp) at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. For data analysis we used BWA (version 0.5.10), duplicate reads were marked employing Picard MarkTools. Peak finding for H3K27Ac was performed using MACS (Zhang et al., 2008) with a p value threshold of 1e-9, and with other settings as default parameters. As a control or each H3K27Ac ChIP-seq sample, its matched genomic DNA was used as the background. BRD4, OTX2, and MITF peaks were called using the same settings. ChIP-sequencing data for H3K27Ac, BRD4, OTX2, and MITF data have been deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive, EGA Study Accession ID EGAS00001001297.
