Illumina genomic plate-based library construction (350-450bp insert size):
2ug of genomic DNA in a 96-well format was fragmented by Covaris E210 sonication for 
30 seconds using a "Duty cycle" of 20% and "Intensity" of 5. The paired-end sequencing 
library was prepared following the BC Cancer Agency's Genome Sciences Centre 96-well 
Genomic ~350bp-450bp insert Illumina Library Construction protocol on a Biomek FX robot 
(Beckman-Coulter, USA). Briefly, the DNA was purified in a 96-well microtitre plate 
using Ampure XP SPRI beads (40-45uL beads per 60uL DNA), and was subject to end-repair, 
and phosphorylation by T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow DNA Polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide 
kinase respectively in a single reaction, followed by cleanup using Ampure XP SPRI beads 
and 3' A-tailing by Klenow fragment (3' to 5' exo minus). After cleanup using Ampure XP 
SPRI beads, picogreen quantification was performed to determine the amount of Illumina 
PE adapters used in the next step of adapter ligation reaction. The adapter-ligated 
products were purified using Ampure XP SPRI beads, then PCR-amplified with Phusion DNA 
Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. USA) using Illumina?s PE indexed primer set, 
with cycle conditions: 98?C for 30sec followed by 6 cycles of 98 degC for 15 sec, 62 degC 
for 30 sec and 72 degC for 30 sec, and a final extension at 72 degC for 5min. The PCR 
products were purified using Ampure XP SPRI beads, and checked with Caliper LabChip GX 
for DNA samples using the High Sensitivity Assay (PerkinElmer, Inc. USA). PCR product 
of the desired size range was gel purified  (8% PAGE or 1.5% Metaphor agarose in an 
in-house custom built robot), and the DNA quality was assessed and quantified using an 
Agilent DNA 1000 series II assay and Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay Kit using Qubit fluorometer 
(Invitrogen), then diluted to 8nM. The final concentration was confirmed by Quant-iT dsDNA 
HS Assay prior to generating 100bp paired end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 
platform using v3 chemistry.
