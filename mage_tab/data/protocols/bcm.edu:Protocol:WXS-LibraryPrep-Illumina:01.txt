Library construction: Specimen processing, DNA extraction, standard QC and Illumina paired-end pre-capture 
libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) 
with the following modifications: 0.5 - 1ug genomic DNA in 100 ul volume was sheared into fragments of 
approximately 300 base pairs in a Covaris E210 system (Covaris, Inc. Woburn, MA). The setting was 10% 
duty cycle, intensity of 4, 200 cycles per burst for 120 seconds. Fragment size was checked using a 2.2% 
Flash Gel DNA Cassette (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, Cat. No.57023). End-repair of fragmented DNA was performed 
in 90 ul total reaction volume containing sheared DNA, 9 ul 10X buffer, 5 ul END Repair Enzyme Mix and H2O 
(NEBNext End-Repair Module, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, Cat. No. E6050L), incubated at 20 degC for 30 
minutes. A-tailing was performed in a total reaction volume of 60 ul containing end-repaired DNA, 6 ul 10X 
buffer, 3 ul Klenow fragment (NEBNext dA-Tailing Module; Cat. No. E6053L) and H2O followed by incubation 
at 37 degC for 30 minutes. Illumina multiplex adapter ligation (NEBNext Quick Ligation Module Cat. No. E6056L) 
was performed in a total reaction volume of 90 ul containing 18 ul 5X buffer, 5 ul ligase, 0.5 ul 100 uM 
adaptor and H2O at room temperature for 30 minutes. After ligation, PCR with Illumina PE 1.0 and modified 
barcode primers (manuscript in preparation) was performed in 170 ul reactions containing 85 ul of 2x Phusion 
High-Fidelity PCR master mix, adaptor ligated DNA, 1.75 ul of 50 uM primers and H2O. PCR was performed using 
a 5 minute initial denaturation at 95C, 6-10 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 degC, 15 seconds at 60 degC and 30 seconds 
at 72 degC followed by a final extension for 5 minute at 72 degC.  Agencourt XP Beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, 
Inc., Danvers, MA, Cat. No. A63882) were used to purify DNA after each enzymatic reaction. After purification, 
PCR product quantification and size distribution was determined using the Caliper GX 1K/12K/High Sensitivity 
Assay Labchip (Hopkinton, MA, Cat. No. 760517).
 
Exome capture: Illumina pre-capture libraries (1 ug DNA input) were hybridized in solution to SeqCap EZ Human 
Exome 2.0 (Nimblegen, Madison, WI) probes targeting approximately 44Mbs of sequence from approximately 30K genes 
according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications: hybridization enhancing oligos IHE1, 
IHE2 and IHE3 replaced oligos HE1.1 and HE2.1 and post-capture LM-PCR was performed using 14 cycles. Capture 
libraries were quantified using Caliper GX 1K/12K/High Sensitivity Assay Labchip (Hopkinton, MA, Cat. No. 760517). 
The efficiency of the capture was evaluated by performing a qPCR-based quality check on the built-in controls 
(qPCR SYBR Green assays, Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY). Four standardized oligo sets, RUNX2, PRKG1, SMG1, 
and NLK, were employed as internal quality controls. The enrichment of the capture libraries was estimated to 
range from 7- to 9-fold over background.
