Gene and isoform expression from RNA-seq data was generated using Cufflinks version 2.1.1. 
with default options and supplied reference annotation (Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.71.gtf) for estimation 
of expression. Cufflinks will not assemble novel transcripts, and it will ignore alignments not 
structurally compatible with any reference transcript.

RPKM for a given exon is determined by:  ( (raw base counts / median read length) * 10^9) / (total reads * exon length). 
The raw base counts for a given exon is the total number of bases aligned to that genomic segment. 
Raw base counts are used instead of raw read counts because in many cases only a portion of a 
read will align to a given exon.
