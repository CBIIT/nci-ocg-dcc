Gene and isoform expression from RNA-seq data was generated using Cufflinks version 2.1.1. 
with default options and supplied reference annotation (Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.71.gtf) for estimation 
of expression. Cufflinks will not assemble novel transcripts, and it will ignore alignments not 
structurally compatible with any reference transcript.

Exon expression file was generated using dexseq_count.py included in R package DEXseq 1.12.1 with 
annotation (Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.71.gff) and default parameters except for -p yes (indicates the data is paired end) 
and -s no (indicates the data is not from a strand-specific assay).
