DepthOfCoverage tool from the GATK (v3.0-0) was run on BAMs from TARGET NBL validation 
cohort data (998 tumor/normal pairs). In order to find copy number changes in this 
targeted gene panel, we used the copy number tool VisCap. VisCap uses DepthOfCoverage 
data in order to find small and large-scale copy number changes across the targeted 
gene panel. The advantage of VisCap is its sensitivity to small-scale copy number 
changes within genes at the exon level. Thus it was deemed appropriate to find focal 
and sub-genic copy number changes in this gene panel.
