DNA samples were constructed into Illumina paired-end libraries and processed through exome capture 
according to the manufacturer's specifications with modifications as described in the BCM-HGSC Illumina 
Barcoded Paired-End Capture Library Preparation protocol 
(https://hgsc.bcm.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Illumina_Barcoded_Paired-End_Capture_Library_Preparation.pdf).

Pre-capture libraries were prepared using Beckman robotic workstations (Biomek NXp and FXp models). 
Briefly, 500ng of DNA was sheared into fragments of approximately 300-400 base pairs in a Covaris plate 
with E210 system (Covaris, Inc. Woburn, MA) followed by end-repair, A-tailing and ligation of the Illumina 
multiplexing PE adaptors.  Pre-capture Ligation Mediated-PCR (LM-PCR) was performed for 6 cycles of 
amplification using the KAPA HiFi DNA Polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Cat. no. KM2602).  Purification 
was performed with Agencourt AMPure XP beads after enzymatic reactions.  Following the final XP beads 
purification, quantification and size distribution of the pre-capture LM-PCR product was determined using 
the LabChip GX electrophoresis system (PerkinElmer).
