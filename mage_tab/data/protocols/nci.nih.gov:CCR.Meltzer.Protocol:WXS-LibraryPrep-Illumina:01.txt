Conventional Illumina DNA sequencing libraries for whole exome sequencing were 
prepared using 1 mcg genomic DNA fragmented to a mean size of approximately 350 
bp in an S1 Covaris Sonicator. Exome sequence was captured for Illumina sequencing 
following the manufacturers' instructions using the Agilent SureSelect Human All 
Exon V3 50Mb Kit or the Illumina TruSeq Exome Enrichment Kit.
